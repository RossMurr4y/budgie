# Budgie

Budgie is a Django web app for fast and simple budgeting following the principals outlined by Scott Pape - the [Barefoot Investor](https://barefootinvestor.com/). 

Budgie has no affiliation with Scott, nor is it to be considered financial advice. It is merely a tool aid in following along with Scott's book.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. All tests must be passing before any PRs will be considered, and new functionality must be accompanied by appropriate TDD test cases. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Please note that this application is designed to be a very simple application - somewhere between a budget in a spreadsheet and a simple implimentation of commercial solutions where the user is not benefiting from all the bells and whistles. New functionality will be considered where it is appropriate, however the budget must remain elegantly simple with minimal setup or maintenance.
